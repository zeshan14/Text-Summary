text = """Readability is the quality of the text that was written. 
If itâ€™s too long and complicated, no one will understand it. 
Measuring the readability is about measuring the text quality. 
This can be done by looking at the keyword density, syllable count 
and the average length of sentences and words in a document. 
Also checking for simpler synonyms or words with a higher word 
prevalence can help. Word prevalence is about word knowledge 
in the crowd and refers to the number of people who know the word.
